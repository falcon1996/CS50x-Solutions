0.  an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.

1.   getrusage() returns resource usage measures  for the calling process,  for all children of the calling process that have terminated 
     and been waited for and for the calling thread.
     
2.   members available in a variable of type struct rusage are 16.

3.  Passing in values involves copying the two 16 member struts which would take some time and memory. Since the purpose of getrusage() is to track
    the resources required (including time and RAM) this would lead to inaccuracies. Additionally, if a rusage struct has an undefined value it is
    autonatically set to zero. This negates any dereferencing crashes or extra checks.
    
4.   Speller.c reads words from the file, character by character, using a for loop to begin reading the first character of 
    the file, incrementing by one character until it reaches the end of the file. If the character is a letter or apostrophe,
    it is added to a word. If the word becomes larger than what we have defined as the largest word possible, the word is
    ignored. If the word has a digit, it is ignored as well.
    
5.   To be able to account for numerical inputs and other punctuation which we have deemed invalid.

6.  Because word LENGTH and DICTIONARY are # declared as constants (word is an array of LENGTH+1)

7.  I used Hash table to implement speller in which i made an array of linked lists and then furthur linked with them with additional nodes.
    Inside nodes a string that represented word and pointer to next node were present.
    
8.  On first attempt total time taken was 4 seconds.

9.  Tries would defenately increase code's performance as compared to hash tables.

10. I used function ctrcasecmp to get away with upper and lowercase errors.
